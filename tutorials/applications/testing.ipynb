    "While `databricks-connect` is convenient for leveraging cluster compute resources, it also makes it difficult to conduct tests quickly. Spinning up a cluster takes around 3-4 minutes, slowing down iterations. Development also becomes very expensive as the `databricks-connect` configuration is attached to a cluster, meaning that it's inconvenient to switch to a smaller cluster for smaller tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process is costly in most developer time with slow iterations, and with cluster costs, having to spin up everytime.\n",
