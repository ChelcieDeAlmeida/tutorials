    "Fugue is an abstraction layer for distributed computing frameworks such as Spark or Dask. The abstraction layer allows users to worry less about the tools they are using, and focus more on the problems they are solving. Often we'll find that logic written for data operations is highly tied to a specific compute framework (Pandas, Spark or Dask). There are many problems that come out of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users have to learn an entirely new framework to work with distributed compute problems\n",
    "2. Logic written for a *small data* project does not become reusable for a *big data* project\n",
    "3. Testing becomes a heavyweight process for distributed compute, especially Spark\n",
    "4. Along with number 3, iterations for distributed compute problems become slower and more expensive\n",

    "Notice the `@transformer` decorator was removed from `map_phone_to_location`. Instead, it was replaced with a comment that specified the schema. Fugue reads in this comment as the schema hint. Now, this function is truly independent of any framework and written in native Python. **It is even independent from Fugue itself.** Fugue only appears when we reach the execution part of the code. Logic, however, is not coupled with any framework. Keen users may also notice that the type annotations in the `concat_and_reverse` caused the DataFrame to be converted before it was used by the function. If users want to offboard from Fugue, they can use their function with Pandas `apply()` or Spark user-defined functions (UDFs).\n",

The main concern of Fugue is clear readable code. **Users can write code in whatever expresses their logic the best**. There will be cases where the Pandas implementation is faster than native Python, especially because of vectorized operations and usage of C. However, the philosophy of Fugue is clean and reusable logic that is portable across frameworks. We demonstrated that Fugue can be used on Pandas and Spark. To use it on Dask, we simply use the `DaskExecutionEngine`. The compute efficiency lost by using Fugue is unlikely to be significant, especially in comparison to the developer efficiency gained through more rapid iterations and easier maintenance. In fact, Fugue is designed in a way that often sees speed ups compared to inexperienced users working with native Spark code. Fugue handles a lot of the tricks necessary to use Spark effectively.\n",

    "## Fugue as a Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue is a framework, but more importantly, it is a mindset. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fugue believes that the framework should adapt to the user, not the other way around\n",
    "2. Fugue lets users code express logic in a scale-agnostic way, with the tools they prefer\n",
    "3. Fugue values readability and maintainability of code over deep framework-specific optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed computing is currently harder than it needs to be. However, these systems often follow similar patterns, which have been abstracted to create a framework that lets users focus on defining their logic. We cover these concepts in the following tutorials. If you're new to distributed computing, Fugue is the perfect place to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison to Modin and Koalas\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue gets compared a lot of Modin and Koalas. Modin is a Pandas interface for execution on Dask, and Koalas is a Pandas interface for execution on Spark. Fugue, Modin, and Koalas have very similar goals in making an easier distributed computing experience. The main difference is that Modin and Koalas use Pandas as the grammar for distributed compute. Fugue, on the other hand, uses native Python and SQL as the grammar for distributed compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The clearest example of Pandas not being compatible with Spark is the acceptance of mixed-typed columns. A single column can have numeric and string values. Spark on the other hand, is strongly typed. More than that, Pandas is strongly reliant on the index for operations. As users transition to Spark, the index mindset does not hold as well. Order is not always guaranteed in a distributed system, and there is an overhead to maintain a global index, even when it is not necessary."
